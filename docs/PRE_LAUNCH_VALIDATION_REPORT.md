## 7. Go/No-Go Recommendation for Launch

**Based on the findings summarized in this report:**

*   [ ] **Go for Launch**: All critical and high-priority issues have been addressed. The platform meets UAT success criteria and performance/security targets.
*   [ ] **Go for Launch (with conditions)**: Minor high/medium priority issues exist but have accepted mitigation plans or are scheduled for immediate post-launch fix. List conditions: [e.g., Resolve ISS-001 within 2 weeks post-launch].
*   [ ] **No-Go (Postpone Launch)**: Critical/high-priority issues remain that pose significant risk to users, data, or system stability. Rework and re-validation required. List blocking issues: [...].

**Justification**:
[Provide a brief rationale for the recommendation.]
