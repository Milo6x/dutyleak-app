# Performance Analysis and Recommendations

## 1. Introduction

This document summarizes the findings from performance testing of the DutyLeak platform, including Lighthouse CI audits and API endpoint profiling. It identifies key performance bottlenecks and provides recommendations for optimization. This is a living document and will be updated as new performance data becomes available and optimizations are implemented.

**Date of Analysis**: [Insert Date]
**Data Sources**:
*   Lighthouse CI Reports (from GitHub Actions workflow, see `.lighthouserc.js` for configuration)
*   API Performance Baseline Data (see `docs/API_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md`)

## 2. Summary of Key Findings

*(This section will be filled in after performance data is collected and analyzed. It should provide a high-level overview of the platform's performance strengths and weaknesses.)*

*   **Overall Frontend Performance (Lighthouse Average Scores)**:
    *   Performance: [Score/100]
    *   Accessibility: [Score/100]
    *   Best Practices: [Score/100]
    *   SEO: [Score/100]
*   **Overall API Performance**:
    *   Average response time for critical GET endpoints: [Time ms]
    *   Average response time for critical POST/PUT endpoints: [Time ms]
*   **Key Performance Bottlenecks Identified**:
    1.  [Bottleneck 1, e.g., Slow loading of Dashboard page]
    2.  [Bottleneck 2, e.g., High TTFB for `/api/analytics/overview`]
    3.  [Bottleneck 3, e.g., Large image assets on product pages]
    4.  ...

## 3. Detailed Analysis and Recommendations

### 3.1 Frontend Performance (Lighthouse CI Findings)

*(For each key page audited by Lighthouse CI, e.g., Home, Dashboard, Products List, Analytics Page)*

#### 3.1.x Page: [Page Name/URL]
*   **Lighthouse Scores**:
    *   Performance: [Score]
    *   Accessibility: [Score]
    *   Best Practices: [Score]
    *   SEO: [Score]
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   First Contentful Paint (FCP): [Time ms]
    *   Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): [Time ms]
    *   Speed Index (SI): [Time ms]
    *   Time to Interactive (TTI): [Time ms]
    *   Total Blocking Time (TBT): [Time ms]
    *   Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): [Score]
*   **Identified Issues & Opportunities (from Lighthouse report)**:
    *   [Issue 1, e.g., "Serve images in next-gen formats"]
    *   [Issue 2, e.g., "Reduce initial server response time (TTFB)"]
    *   [Issue 3, e.g., "Eliminate render-blocking resources"]
    *   [Issue 4, e.g., "Minify JavaScript/CSS"] (Though Next.js handles much of this)
    *   [Issue 5, e.g., "Ensure text remains visible during webfont load"]
*   **Recommendations**:
    *   [Recommendation 1 for Issue 1, e.g., "Implement image optimization using `next/image` for all user-facing images."]
    *   [Recommendation 2 for Issue 2, e.g., "Investigate server-side rendering performance or API calls blocking initial render."]
    *   ...

### 3.2 Backend API Performance

*(For each critical API endpoint profiled, refer to `docs/API_PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.md` for baseline numbers)*

#### 3.2.x Endpoint: [HTTP Method] [Endpoint Path]
*   **Baseline Performance (Small/Large Dataset)**:
    *   Avg Response Time: [Time ms] / [Time ms]
    *   TTFB: [Time ms] / [Time ms]
    *   P95 Response Time: [Time ms] / [Time ms]
*   **Identified Issues (if any)**:
    *   [Issue 1, e.g., "High latency under large dataset conditions for `/api/products` GET list."]
    *   [Issue 2, e.g., "N+1 query problem identified in `/api/dashboard/stats`."]
    *   [Issue 3, e.g., "Slow data processing logic in `POST /api/classification/classify` before AI call."]
*   **Recommendations**:
    *   [Recommendation 1 for Issue 1, e.g., "Implement proper database indexing on `products` table for common filter/sort fields. Optimize query to reduce data fetched if possible."]
    *   [Recommendation 2 for Issue 2, e.g., "Refactor data fetching in `/api/dashboard/stats` to use fewer, more efficient queries or joins."]
    *   [Recommendation 3 for Issue 3, e.g., "Profile and optimize pre-processing logic. Consider offloading parts to background job if not time-critical for response."]
    *   [General Recommendation: Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis, in-memory cache with TTL) for frequently accessed, rarely changing data.]

*(Repeat for other key API endpoints)*

## 4. Prioritized List of Optimizations

*(Based on the impact and feasibility, list the recommended optimizations in order of priority.)*

1.  **High Priority**:
    *   [Optimization Task 1, e.g., Optimize images on product pages using `next/image`.]
    *   [Optimization Task 2, e.g., Add database index to `products.workspace_id` and `products.category`.]
2.  **Medium Priority**:
    *   [Optimization Task 3, e.g., Investigate and refactor `/api/dashboard/stats` for query efficiency.]
    *   [Optimization Task 4, e.g., Implement code splitting for large frontend components on Analytics page.]
3.  **Low Priority / Future Consideration**:
    *   [Optimization Task 5, e.g., Explore server-side caching for API responses.]

## 5. Next Steps

*   Create specific tasks/tickets in the project management system for each prioritized optimization.
*   Assign tasks to developers.
*   After implementing optimizations, re-run performance tests (Lighthouse, API profiling) to measure improvement and update baselines.
*   Continuously monitor performance as the application evolves.
