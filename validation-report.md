# DutyLeak Validation Report

## Overview

This document outlines the validation process and results for the enhanced DutyLeak application. All new features and modifications have been tested to ensure they meet the requirements and function as expected.

## Features Validated

### 1. FBA Fee Handling

- **Database Schema**: Verified that the `products` table includes `fba_fee_estimate_usd` and `yearly_units` columns, and the `duty_calculations` table includes `fba_fee_amount` column.
- **API Endpoints**: Tested the `/api/amazon/calculate-fba-fees` endpoint with various product dimensions, weights, and ASINs.
- **Integration**: Confirmed that FBA fees are correctly incorporated into landed cost calculations.

### 2. Scenario Modeling

- **Database Schema**: Verified that the `duty_scenarios` table is properly structured with all required fields.
- **API Endpoints**: Tested the `/api/scenarios` endpoint for creating and retrieving scenarios.
- **Functionality**: Confirmed that scenario comparisons correctly calculate potential savings based on different classifications.

### 3. Optimization Recommendations

- **Database Schema**: Verified that the `optimization_recommendations` table is properly structured.
- **API Endpoints**: Tested the `/api/optimization` endpoint for generating recommendations.
- **Job System**: Confirmed that the background job for optimization analysis works correctly.

### 4. Review Queue

- **Database Schema**: Verified that the `review_queue` table is properly structured.
- **API Endpoints**: Tested the `/api/review-queue` endpoints for listing, approving, and overriding classifications.
- **Workflow**: Confirmed that the review process correctly updates product classifications.

### 5. Enhanced CSV Import

- **API Endpoints**: Tested the `/api/import/csv` endpoint with various CSV files.
- **AI Mapping**: Verified that the AI-assisted column mapping correctly identifies and maps columns.
- **Validation**: Confirmed that row validation correctly identifies and reports errors.

### 6. Global Date Range Selector

- **Component**: Verified that the `DateRangeProvider` correctly manages date ranges.
- **URL Synchronization**: Confirmed that date ranges are properly synchronized with URL parameters.
- **Persistence**: Verified that date ranges are saved to localStorage for persistence.

## Performance Testing

- **Database Queries**: Optimized queries with appropriate indexes for performance.
- **API Response Times**: Tested API endpoints with large datasets to ensure acceptable response times.
- **Background Jobs**: Verified that long-running tasks are properly handled by the job system.

## Security Testing

- **Authentication**: Confirmed that all API endpoints require proper authentication.
- **Row-Level Security**: Verified that RLS policies are correctly applied to all tables.
- **Input Validation**: Tested API endpoints with invalid inputs to ensure proper error handling.

## Conclusion

All features have been successfully validated and meet the requirements. The enhanced DutyLeak application provides a robust solution for HS classification, duty rate lookup, landed cost calculation, and optimization recommendations, with improved usability through features like the review queue, enhanced CSV import, and global date range selector.
