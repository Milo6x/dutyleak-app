# DutyLeak - Complete Production-Ready Application Development
## Review-Then-Implement Methodology

## Project Overview
Develop DutyLeak into a fully functional, production-ready AI-powered duty optimization platform using a **Review-Then-Implement** methodology. This approach ensures we understand existing code quality, identify what's already functional, and build upon existing foundations rather than rebuilding from scratch.

## Review-Then-Implement Methodology

### Core Principles
1. **Review First**: Before implementing any feature, conduct thorough code review to understand current state
2. **Assess Implementation Status**: Determine what's working, partially working, or missing
3. **Incremental Enhancement**: Build upon existing code rather than replacing it
4. **Quality-Driven Development**: Focus on code quality, testing, and maintainability

### Assessment Criteria for Each Feature
For each major feature, we will evaluate:
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript compliance, error handling, code structure
- **Functionality**: What works end-to-end vs. what's incomplete
- **Integration**: How well components connect with database, APIs, and UI
- **Testing**: Existing test coverage and quality
- **Performance**: Current performance characteristics
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, and data protection

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Code Review Phase**: Analyze existing implementation
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing functionality and quality issues
3. **Refactoring Phase**: Improve existing code quality
4. **Implementation Phase**: Build missing functionality
5. **Integration Testing**: Ensure new and existing code work together
6. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and validation

## Current Status
- Basic MVP structure exists with core API endpoints
- Authentication infrastructure partially implemented
- Database schema established
- UI components created but with integration issues
- Critical bugs preventing proper functionality

## Goals
1. **Review & Assess**: Comprehensive review of existing codebase
2. **Fix Critical Issues**: Resolve authentication loops, loading issues, and TypeScript errors
3. **Complete Core Features**: Implement all missing functionality for a working MVP
4. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing strategy and implementation
5. **Production Readiness**: Deployment, monitoring, and maintenance setup
6. **Documentation**: Complete technical and user documentation
7. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure scalable, fast, and reliable operation
