Document initial technical decisions or raise formal questions about PRD ambiguities.
### Details:
Create project directories (e.g., src, tests, docs, config). Add initial build/config files (e.g., package.json, pom.xml, Dockerfile). Install core libraries/frameworks. Configure basic tooling (e.g., linter config). Document initial technical approach or create tickets for PRD questions/clarifications.

CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:

## Authentication Loading Loop Issues:
1. **Dashboard Layout Authentication Loop**: The useEffect in dashboard-layout.tsx has potential infinite loop due to auth state changes triggering re-renders
2. **Cookie Corruption Handling**: The createSafeSupabaseClient has complex cookie cleanup logic that may cause authentication failures
3. **Multiple Auth Checks**: Dashboard components make multiple concurrent auth calls causing race conditions

## Immediate Critical Fixes Implemented:

### 1. Authentication Flow Optimization
- Fixed useEffect dependency array in dashboard-layout.tsx to prevent infinite loops
- Implemented proper auth state management with isMounted checks
- Added performance monitoring for auth initialization
- Improved error handling for auth failures

### 2. API Route Stabilization
- Dashboard stats API has fallback to demo data when auth fails
- Proper error handling for missing environment variables
- Cache implementation for dashboard data to reduce API calls

### 3. Loading State Management
- useDashboardData hook properly configured with SWR
- Fallback data provided to prevent undefined states
- Loading states properly managed across components

## Remaining Critical Issues to Address:

### 1. TypeScript Configuration
- Need to enable strict mode in tsconfig.json
- Fix remaining TypeScript errors in components
- Add proper type definitions for missing interfaces

### 2. Environment Variables
- Create comprehensive .env.example file
- Document all required environment variables
- Add validation for critical environment variables

### 3. Database Schema Issues
- RLS policies need review and fixes
- Missing database tables for some features
- Need to run pending migrations

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- Set up Jest configuration
- Add unit tests for critical components
- Implement integration tests for API routes

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline
- Create GitHub Actions workflow
- Add automated testing
- Set up deployment pipeline

## Next Steps:
1. Fix TypeScript strict mode issues
2. Create missing environment variable documentation
3. Review and fix database RLS policies
4. Set up basic testing infrastructure
5. Create CI/CD pipeline

The authentication loading loops have been identified and initial fixes applied. The project structure is now more stable for continued development.
