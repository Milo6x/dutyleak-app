# Task ID: 3
# Title: Phase 1: Fix Core TypeScript Errors and Code Quality Issues
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Resolve all TypeScript compilation errors and address major code quality issues identified during assessment.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix TypeScript Compilation Errors and Type Violations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Resolve all errors reported by the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and ensure strict type checking passes. This includes fixing incorrect type annotations, missing types, and type mismatches.
### Details:
Run `tsc --noEmit` or equivalent to identify all compilation errors. Systematically go through each error, understand its root cause (e.g., incorrect usage of variables, missing properties, wrong function signatures), and apply the correct TypeScript fix. Prioritize errors that block compilation.

## 2. Address Code Quality and Linting Issues [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Resolve warnings and errors reported by the configured linter (e.g., ESLint, TSLint) and formatter (e.g., Prettier). Ensure code adheres to established coding standards.
### Details:
Run the linter and formatter tools. Configure IDE integration if possible to see issues in real-time. Fix reported issues such as unused variables, inconsistent formatting, potential bugs identified by linting rules, and code style violations. Aim for a clean linting report.

## 3. Improve Application-Wide Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Standardize error handling mechanisms across the application. Implement consistent error logging, user-friendly error responses, and proper propagation of errors.
### Details:
Review existing error handling patterns. Introduce a consistent approach for catching and handling errors (e.g., using centralized middleware, custom error classes). Ensure errors are logged appropriately with sufficient context. Standardize API error response formats. Implement graceful error handling in UI components.

## 4. Resolve Authentication Flow Issues and Infinite Loops [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Debug and fix issues within the authentication and authorization flows, specifically addressing reported infinite loops or incorrect state transitions.
### Details:
Analyze the authentication logic, including login, logout, token handling, and route guarding. Identify the root cause of infinite loops (e.g., incorrect redirect logic, state management issues, race conditions). Refactor the authentication flow to be robust and predictable, leveraging improved error handling.

## 5. Optimize Database Queries and Resolve N+1 Patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Identify and optimize inefficient database queries, including resolving N+1 query patterns and adding necessary indexes.
### Details:
Use database profiling tools or ORM features to identify slow queries and N+1 patterns. Refactor queries to use joins, eager loading, or batching where appropriate. Analyze query execution plans and add database indexes to frequently queried columns. Ensure transactions are used correctly.

## 6. Identify and Address API Performance Bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Profile API endpoints to identify performance bottlenecks beyond database queries and implement optimizations such as caching, reducing external calls, or optimizing business logic.
### Details:
Use API profiling tools or middleware to measure response times for key endpoints. Analyze the call stack to identify where time is being spent (e.g., external API calls, complex calculations, lack of caching). Implement caching strategies (in-memory, Redis) for frequently accessed data. Optimize complex business logic or integrate third-party services more efficiently.
