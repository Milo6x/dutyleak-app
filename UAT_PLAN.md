# DutyLeak Platform - User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the plan for User Acceptance Testing (UAT) of the DutyLeak platform. The purpose of UAT is to validate that the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable to the target users/stakeholders before final release.

### 1.2 UAT Objectives
*   Confirm that DutyLeak functions as expected in real-world scenarios.
*   Validate that key user journeys are intuitive, efficient, and complete.
*   Ensure the platform meets the needs and expectations of different user personas.
*   Identify any critical defects, usability issues, or gaps in functionality from a user perspective.
*   Gain stakeholder confidence and formal acceptance of the platform.

### 1.3 Scope of UAT
UAT will cover the following key areas and functionalities of the DutyLeak platform:
*   User Onboarding (Signup, Login, Workspace Creation)
*   Product Management (Manual Add, CSV Import, View/Edit)
*   HS Code Classification (Single, Bulk, Review Queue)
*   Landed Cost and FBA Fee Calculation Viewing
*   Scenario Modeling (Creation, Comparison, Optimization)
*   Analytics & Reporting (Dashboard, Comprehensive Analytics, Export)
*   Admin Functions (User Management, Job Monitoring)
*   Core user documentation (Getting Started, Tutorials) for clarity and accuracy.

**Out of Scope for this UAT cycle (unless specified otherwise):**
*   Detailed performance/load testing (covered in separate performance testing phase).
*   Exhaustive testing of all edge cases (focus is on common user flows).
*   Code-level security vulnerability testing (covered in security testing phase).
*   Non-functional requirements not directly impacting user experience (e.g., detailed infrastructure resilience).

## 2. UAT Participants & Roles

### 2.1 UAT Testers (User Personas)
The following user personas will be represented during UAT:
*   **E-commerce Manager / Business Owner**: Focus on overall usability, cost optimization benefits, profitability analysis, and strategic decision-making capabilities.
*   **Logistics/Supply Chain Coordinator**: Focus on product data management, import/export workflows, landed cost accuracy, and scenario modeling for sourcing.
*   **Customs Specialist / Compliance Officer**: Focus on HS code classification accuracy, review queue functionality, and compliance aspects.
*   **Workspace Administrator**: Focus on user management, job monitoring, and workspace settings.
*   **(Optional) New User Persona**: To test the onboarding experience and ease of learning.

*(Specific stakeholder names or departments will be identified closer to the UAT execution phase.)*

### 2.2 UAT Coordination Team
*   **UAT Coordinator**: [Name/Role, e.g., Product Manager or QA Lead] - Responsible for overall UAT planning, execution, and reporting.
*   **Technical Support**: [Name/Role, e.g., Lead Developer] - Available to assist UAT testers with technical issues and environment setup.
*   **Business Analyst/Product Owner**: To clarify requirements and answer functional questions.

## 3. UAT Environment & Data

### 3.1 UAT Environment
*   **URL**: [Specify Staging/UAT Environment URL]
*   **Access**: UAT participants will be provided with login credentials for the UAT environment.
*   **Stability**: The UAT environment should be stable and closely mirror the production environment in terms of functionality and configuration.

### 3.2 Test Data
*   A representative set of test data will be prepared and pre-loaded into the UAT environment. This will include:
    *   Sample user accounts with different roles.
    *   A catalog of products with varying attributes (categories, origins, complexities).
    *   Pre-existing classification data (some correct, some needing review).
    *   Sample historical job data.
    *   Sample analytics data.
*   UAT testers will also be encouraged to use their own (anonymized or sample) data where appropriate to simulate real-world usage.

## 4. UAT Scenarios & Test Cases

UAT will be based on executing high-level scenarios that represent key user journeys. Detailed test steps will be provided for each scenario.

*(Refer to the User Documentation (Tutorials section) and Testing Plan (E2E Test Cases section) for detailed steps for many of these scenarios.)*

## 5. UAT Schedule & Duration

*   **UAT Preparation Phase**: [Start Date] - [End Date] (Includes environment setup, data prep, finalization of UAT scenarios)
*   **UAT Execution Phase**: [Start Date] - [End Date] (e.g., 1-2 weeks)
*   **UAT Daily Debriefs (Optional)**: Short daily meetings to discuss progress and issues.
*   **Feedback Consolidation & Review**: [Start Date] - [End Date]
*   **UAT Sign-off Meeting**: [Date]

## 6. Success Criteria

UAT will be considered successful if:
*   At least [e.g., 90%] of defined UAT scenarios are completed successfully by the testers.
*   No critical or high-severity defects (blockers, major functionality failures, data corruption) remain unresolved at the end of the UAT period.
*   A [e.g., predefined number or percentage] of medium-severity defects are addressed or have a clear resolution plan.
*   Key stakeholders provide formal sign-off indicating the platform is acceptable for release from a user perspective.

## 7. Feedback Collection & Defect Management

*   **Feedback Form**: A standardized UAT feedback form will be provided to testers for each scenario, allowing them to record:
    *   Scenario ID executed.
    *   Pass/Fail status.
    *   Steps taken.
    *   Actual vs. Expected results.
    *   Any defects encountered (with screenshots if possible).
    *   Usability comments and suggestions.
*   **Issue Tracker**: All identified defects will be logged in the project's issue tracking system (e.g., Jira, GitHub Issues) with appropriate severity, priority, and steps to reproduce.
*   **Communication Channel**: A dedicated channel (e.g., Slack, Teams) will be available for UAT participants to ask questions and report urgent issues.

## 8. Roles & Responsibilities (UAT Phase)

*   **UAT Participants**: Execute assigned UAT scenarios, provide detailed feedback, report defects, and participate in debrief sessions.
*   **UAT Coordinator**: Manages the UAT process, distributes materials, tracks progress, triages defects, and facilitates communication.
*   **Development Team**: Provides technical support during UAT, investigates reported defects, and implements fixes for critical issues.
*   **Product Owner/Manager**: Answers functional questions, clarifies requirements, and participates in defect prioritization and UAT sign-off.

## 9. UAT Sign-off

Upon completion of UAT execution and review of findings, a UAT sign-off meeting will be held. Formal sign-off will be requested from key stakeholders, indicating their acceptance of the platform based on the UAT results.

---
This UAT Plan will be reviewed and approved by project stakeholders before the commencement of UAT activities.
