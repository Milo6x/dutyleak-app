## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 5.1 (FBA Fee UI)** - Highest business impact
2. **Implement Task 5.4 (Review Queue UI)** - Critical for workflow
3. **Continue with Task 5.2 (Scenario Modeler)** - High user value
4. **Add Task 5.3 (Optimization Suggestions)** - Medium priority
5. **Complete with Task 5.5 (Profitability Analytics)** - Advanced features

Each task should be completed with full testing and documentation before moving to the next.
